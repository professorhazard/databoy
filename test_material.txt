This is a sample physics course material covering Newton's Laws of Motion.

Chapter 1: Newton's First Law
An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force. This is the law of inertia.

Chapter 2: Newton's Second Law
Force equals mass times acceleration: F = ma. This is the fundamental equation of classical mechanics.

Chapter 3: Newton's Third Law
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Important Concepts:
- Acceleration and velocity
- Friction and air resistance
- Momentum and conservation of momentum
- Work and energy
- Kinetic and potential energy
